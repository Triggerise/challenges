# Triggerise Magic Challenge

As a user, I want to see details about `Magic: The Gathering` sets/cards and generate random boosters for a chosen set.

1) I should be able to pick a set from a list and see the list of cards belonging to it;
2) I should be able to pick a card and see its details (name, colors, image).
3) I should be able to get a random booster from a specific set. From these I should be able to list the cards and see their details (points 1 and 2);

### Details

In order to solve this user story we will give you a little help:
- We recommend you use [this API](https://magicthegathering.io/);
- We don't need complex animations or layouts, but it should be functional and easy to use;
- You can use 3rd party libraries (keep in mind that you will have to justify your options when we analyze your solution).

**Keep also in mind that**:
- The code should be written as production-ready code. You will write production code if you work at Triggerise;
- The code should be easy to grow and easy to add new functionality;
- Performance should be an important feature of the app;
- Tests (Unit, UI, ...) are not mandatory, but always a nice touch.

### Delivery

During the technical interview with the team we will go through your solution and discuss your implementation decisions.

It's important to note that more than your decisions it's how you can justify them so keep this in mind - there often are no right and wrong answers or decisions.

You should provide us with your code a couple of days before so we can go through it. The preferred method of delivery is by sending us a GitHub repository with your application but you can also send us a `.zip` file if you prefer.
